/**
 * This is a test-based tutorial introducing to randomized JUnit testing using
 * {@link RandomizedRunner}. Follow test cases in their alphabetic order. 
 * 
 * <p>One way to start using {@link RandomizedRunner} is to declare
 * your suite class as being executed by {@link RandomizedRunner} (using
 * {@link RunWith} annotation). The {@link #success()} method doesn't do anything
 * useful but runs under {@link RandomizedRunner}. We know this for sure because we
 * can hide a hook {@link #before()} method to be private 
 * (and normal JUnit doesn't allow this).
