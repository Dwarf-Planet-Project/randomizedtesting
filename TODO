
Approximately in the order of importance...
===========================================

- Add a Random delegate to prevent setSeed(); or an aspect to do so?
- RandomizedRunner: method shuffling (hooks, tests); make it _consistent_ based on the runner's seed.

- add tests to all methods in RandomizedTest (!).
- Threads [hangs, deadlocks, interrupting]

- How to simulate 'tests.iter.min'?
- Rewrite LuceneTestCase on top of RandomizedRunner => prove it is functional.
- More runner tests (compliance with standard JUnit in particular)
- RandomizedRunner: more validations
- Can we integrate with TestNG too?
- What about TestRule support (introduced in 4.9?). If we rely on it explicitly, will this cause problems with older shells (ant, eclipse)?


New LTC:
    - Locale and TimeZone randomization => per test suite? Once?
    - Disk throttling. => aspect.


Other things
============

RandomizedRunner currently logs all exceptions when executing tests (test exceptions, after exception, etc.). This results
in:

- Eclipse shows all exceptions next to a test case node [NICE],
- ant: shows both exceptions in xml and plain text dumps (and in reports) [NICE],
- maven shows and logs the test case multiplied for all exceptions (weird, but can be understood and all information is there),


LuceneTestCase features intentionally omitted
=============================================

tests.verbose - What's the point of this anyway? Most test hosts will buffer and redirect sysout/syserr anyway.
tempDir - Override the entire -Djava.io.tmpdir=... instead.

There is an important difference in how we repeat tests: we do full loop (hooks, test case), LTC does simple method repetitions.

test iterations (globally overriden) should always be _safe_ because they re-run entire hook chain and 
   execute on different objects. So this note from LTC should no longer apply: 
   System.out.println("WARNING: you are using -Dtests.iter=n where n > 1, not all tests support this option.");
   System.out.println("Some may crash or fail: this is not a bug.");
