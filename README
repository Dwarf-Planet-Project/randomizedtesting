
JUnit extensions for testing with pseudo-randomness
===================================================

runner - A JUnit runner and base classes for testing with repeatable 
    pseudo-randomness.

integration-ant - A <junit4> task for ANT for running tests in multiple 
    JVMs, better listener support, etc.

integration-maven - A Maven plugin and mojos for running tests in multiple 
    JVMs, better listener support, etc. This works via integration with
    ANT, but is seamless with maven.
    
examples - A mini-tutorial which shows how to use randomized runner using
    increasingly more complex examples.
